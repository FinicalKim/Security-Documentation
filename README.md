# Security-Documentation
A detailed cybersecurity analysis for mock company Strife.

System Security Plans (SSP)
Exercise: Select a system (e.g., a web application) and outline the security controls you would implement. Document these controls in an SSP format.
Resources: NIST SP 800-18 for SSP templates and guidelines.

Security Assessment Reports (SAR)
Exercise: Conduct a mock security assessment on a chosen system or network. Identify vulnerabilities and document your findings in a SAR.
Resources: NIST SP 800-30 for guidelines on conducting risk assessments.

Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
Exercise: Based on your SAR, create a POA&M document detailing the steps needed to remediate identified vulnerabilities, including timelines and resources.
Resources: NIST SP 800-37 for POA&M templates and examples.

Security Control Traceability Matrix (SCTM)
Exercise: Create an SCTM for your mock system, mapping security controls to specific regulatory requirements or standards.
Resources: NIST SP 800-53 for control families and CNSSI 1253 for traceability examples.

Incident Response Documentation
Exercise: Develop an incident response plan for a hypothetical security incident (e.g., a data breach). Outline the detection, response, mitigation, and recovery steps.
Resources: NIST SP 800-61 for incident response guidelines and templates.

Policies and Procedures
Exercise: Write security policies and procedures for your mock organization, covering areas like access control, data protection, and incident management.
Resources: ISO/IEC 27002 for information security policies and procedures.

Compliance and Audit Reports
Exercise: Simulate an internal audit of your mock system. Compile a report demonstrating compliance with relevant standards (e.g., NIST, ISO).
Resources: NIST SP 800-53A for audit and assessment procedures.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans
Exercise: Develop a disaster recovery and business continuity plan for your mock organization. Include strategies for backup, recovery, and maintaining operations during a disruption.
Resources: NIST SP 800-34 for disaster recovery and business continuity planning.
